# ðŸ§  End-to-End Data Science Projects

Welcome! This repository contains a curated collection of data science projects that demonstrate the complete lifecycle of solving real-world problems using data.

Each project focuses on different aspects of the data science process â€” from framing the business problem and performing exploratory data analysis, to feature engineering, building machine learning models, and communicating results through visualization and interpretation. Some projects take a case study approach, while others emphasize statistical analysis, predictive modeling, or dashboard creation.

Whether itâ€™s scraping and analyzing stock market data, predicting cancer diagnoses, or visualizing wildfire trends, these projects reflect a hands-on, end-to-end approach to data science in Python using Jupyter notebooks.

## 1. [Data Science Methodology: A Case Study](https://github.com/JayshreeMishra/understanding_data_science_methodology)

This is a case study for the Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction Model. You can find the project [here](link_to_project).

- **Business Understanding:**
  - Explores the initial step in the Data Science Methodology.
  - Demonstrates the application of data science practices at each stage to address the identified business problem.

## 2. [Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data](https://github.com/JayshreeMishra/extracting_and_visualizing_stock_data)

### Overview

This project involves extracting and visualizing stock data for Tesla and GameStop. The data is obtained using the yfinance library and web scraping for historical stock prices and revenue data, respectively. Visualizations are created using plotly for an interactive and informative presentation.

## 3. [Chicago Data Analysis with SQLite](https://github.com/JayshreeMishra/chicago-data_analysis_with_sqlite)

### Introduction

This project analyzes three datasets from the city of Chicago using SQLite. It delves into the city's data to extract insights and patterns.

## 4. [Insurance Cost Analysis](https://github.com/JayshreeMishra/insurance_cost_analysis)

### Project Overview

An analysis of an insurance cost dataset using Python and various data analysis tools. The dataset includes information about individuals, such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges.

## 5. [Analyzing Wildfire Activities in Australia (Data Visualization)](https://github.com/JayshreeMishra/analyzing_wildfire_activities_in_australia/tree/main)

### Introduction

This project involves the analysis and visualization of historical wildfire data in Australia. The dataset includes information on various aspects of wildfires, such as the region, date, estimated fire area, mean estimated fire brightness, and more.

### Project Overview

Visualizations explore different aspects of wildfire data, highlighting trends over time, distribution across regions, and relationships between various parameters.

## 6. [SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction](https://github.com/JayshreeMishra/spacex_falcon9_first_stage_landing_prediction)

### Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the landing success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage rockets. The process involves data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning modeling. The project utilizes a variety of technologies and tools, including HTTP requests, Beautiful Soup for web scraping, Pandas DataFrames for data manipulation, SQL for analysis, and machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, SVM, decision trees, and KNN for prediction.

## 7. Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Data

### Overview

In this project, we delve into the realm of retail data analysis, aiming to extract meaningful insights to support critical business decisions. As an entry-level data analyst at an online retail company, our focus is on unraveling patterns and trends hidden within transactional data.

## 8. [Statistical Data Visualization with Seaborn](https://github.com/JayshreeMishra/statistical_data_visualization_with_seaborn)

### Overview

This project employs the statistical data visualization library, Seaborn, to discover and explore relationships in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and the application of a boosted decision tree classifier with XGBoost to classify tumors as either malignant or benign.
